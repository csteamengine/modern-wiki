# How I Made This Wiki

Welcome! This page explains how I created this wiki using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io), a modern static site generator that makes it easy to build documentation websites.

---

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- **[Docusaurus v2](https://docusaurus.io/)** — Static site generator built with React  
- **Markdown & MDX** — For writing content  
- **[GitHub](https://github.com/)** — Version control and hosting source files  
- **[Vercel](https://vercel.com/)** — Instant deployment and hosting  
- **[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)** — My preferred markdown editor for feature-rich note-taking
- **[Webstorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/)** — For advanced code editing and navigation

## 🧱 Folder Structure

The basic layout of the site looks like this:

```
modern-wiki/
├── docs/              # Markdown pages for the wiki
│   ├── Projects/      # Subfolder for project-specific documentation
│   ├── Topics/        # Subfolder for topic-specific documentation
│   ├── Resources/     # Subfolder for resource links
│   └── ...
├── sidebars.js        # Sidebar navigation configuration
├── docusaurus.config.js # Site settings and theme
├── static/            # Public assets (images, files)
├── src/               # Custom React components, CSS overrides
│   ├── index.md
│   ├── how-i-made-this-wiki.md
│   └── ...
```

---

## 🚀 Deployment Workflow

1. **Write pages** in Obsidian or a code editor and commit to GitHub.  
2. Vercel is set up to auto-deploy on every push to the main branch.  
3. Changes go live instantly — no manual build step needed.

## ⚙️ Sidebar Configuration

To control the order of pages in the left-hand sidebar, I use this in each file’s frontmatter:

```md
---
title: My Page
sidebar_position: 3
---
```

The sidebar itself is autogenerated from the `/docs` folder, as configured in `sidebars.js`:

```js
module.exports = {
  sidebar: [{ type: 'autogenerated', dirName: '.' }],
};
```

---

## 💡 Tips

- Use `sidebar_position` to control the order of navigation items
- You can embed React components directly with `.mdx` files
- Add collapsible sections with `category` items in a manual sidebar if needed
- Use GitHub Issues to track ideas or TODOs for your wiki
