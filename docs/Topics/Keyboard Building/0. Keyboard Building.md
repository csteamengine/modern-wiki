# Keyboard Building
If you've found this wiki, you're interested in building or designing and building your own keyboard. Well... I guess I can't really say that you've found the right place, but you've found A place, and I guess that's something.

In the couple of pages I have dedicated to Keyboard building, I try to outline my knowledge on the subject, but I'll also try to be clear on what I'm not an expert in.

In this section, I'll try my best to cover the following:
1. Layout Design
2. PCB Design
3. Firmware
4. Choosing Hardware

In the likely event that my coverage of those topics is lacking, I strongly recommend you seek more information from one or ALL of the following resources:
### Keyboard Atelier
- [https://kbatelier.org/](https://kbatelier.org/)

### QMK Documentation
- [https://docs.qmk.fm](https://docs.qmk.fm)

### Or the Gurus I learned from
- [AI03](https://ai03.com/)
- [Tzarc](https://github.com/tzarc/keyboards)
- [Drashna](https://github.com/drashna)
