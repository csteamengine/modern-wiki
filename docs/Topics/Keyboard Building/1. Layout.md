# Designing the Layout
The layout, in this context, is the physical configuration of the keys on your keyboard--not to be confused with the keymap, which is the firmware configuration.

Unfortunately, planning your keyboard layout is kinda a one-time thing, so you should definitely spend a good bit of time on this step.

## Tools
There are several options in terms of tools for planning your keyboard layout, but the one that I have used (and recommend), is [Keyboard Layout Editor](https://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/).
