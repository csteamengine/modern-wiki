# Projects

**Disclaimer:**  
All projects shared here are DIY and provided as-is. They’re based on my own experimentation and may have quirks, imperfections, or unexpected results. While I do my best to share accurate and useful information, I can’t guarantee everything will work flawlessly in your setup. Build, modify, and explore at your own risk — and most importantly, have fun learning along the way!
